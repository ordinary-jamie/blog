In this post, I'm going to show you the low-level workings of a web server in Python, and how Python's WSGI specification helps us separate server logic from application logic.

We're going to get into the nitty-gritty and build a web server with just the low-level socket system calls.

You can see our server code here (only for demonstration): [üìë servr.py](/blog/7/servr.py)

Then, I'll quickly go through some key points in CPython's implementation of `HTTPServer` and its WSGI reference implementation to show you how a real server works.

[TOC]

## A quick definition

!tldr{
    WSGI is a standard to specify how servers should interact with Python web applications (e.g. Flask)
}

WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) is an interface specification (read ‚Äústandard‚Äù) detailing how servers and applications communicate. That is to say, WSGI is not any kind of software, but rather a document to specify how things should behave.

WSGI is defined in¬†[PEP 3333: Python Web Server Gateway Interface v1.0.1](https://peps.python.org/pep-3333/)[^pe1].

Pragmatically speaking, this allows us to separate the server HTTP handling logic, with the application logic. For example, if we had a simple Flask app:

``` py
# app.py

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return "Hello world\n"
```

Then we can opt to use our own WSGI server, as opposed to Flask's default Werkzeug WSGI web server:

``` py
# servr.py

from app import app

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
    server = make_server('localhost', 4000, app)
    server.handle_request()
```

Here, we are using the [built-in reference implementation for WSGI servers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wsgiref.html)[^py1] and handling just one single request before exiting.

WSGI is the specification that allows for this 'plug-and-play' behaviour through standardized interfaces between WSGI applications (such as Flask and Django) and WSGI servers (Werkzeug, Gunicorn, uWSGI, etc.).

## Web servers

!tldr{
    Servers handle HTTP requests. We'll see how to implement a basic echo-server with low-level Sockets...
}

To fully appreciate WSGI, we first need to go through some basics of web servers. **But quickly, a clarification on nomenclature...**

In most modern contexts, ‚Äúweb server‚Äù and ‚Äúapp server‚Äù are interchangeable terms, and colloquially refer to a server that responds to web requests.

However, in the context of WSGI, these two terms are different and WSGI is the interface between the web server (or "gateway") and the app server (or "framework").

Broadly, and very simply:

- **Web servers**¬†*accepts and fulfill client requests for static content (files stored on the server).*¬†That is, their primary responsibility is simply to handle the incoming HTTP requests, and respond with a fixed (-static) response.
- **App servers**¬†*generate those files on the fly.*¬†That is, application server extend that capability by generating dynamic content based on business logic.

### A quick review on sockets

!tldr{
    Sockets are the abstractions for network communication.
}

!note{
    All of the code below is only for demonstration purposes, and will be missing a lot of crucial case & error handling! Their logic has been stripped down to the absolute bare minimum!
}

I highly recommend reading [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/)[^be1] if you want to know more, but **very** generally:

- Sockets are file descriptors that serve as endpoints for sending data across a network.
- The most basic server will have a 4 step process with corresponding socket system-calls:

    1. `socket()`: Create the socket descriptor
    2. `bind()`: Bind the socket for communication with an IP address and port
    3. `listen()`: mark a socket as passive as to indicate it will be used to accept incoming  connection requests
    4. `accept()`: Get the next connection request on the listen queue

To implement this in Python, we use the low-level networking interface [`Lib/socket.py`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)[^py2]

``` py
# single_socket.py
import socket

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.bind(('', 8082))
    s.listen()

    c, _ = s.accept()
    print(
        c.recv(1024).decode("utf-8")
    )
    c.close()

```

Here, we created an IPv4 (`AF_INET`) TCP socket (`SOCK_STREAM`). We then bound it to all available connections on the host machine on port 8082, and marked it to `.listen()` for inbound connections.

We then `.accept()` to get the first connection request on the queue and `.recv()` / read 1024 bytes, which we then `print()`-ed.

You can run this with:

``` bash
‚ûú python single_socket.py &
#    [1] 47611

‚ûú curl localhost:8082
#    GET / HTTP/1.1
#    Host: localhost:8082
#    User-Agent: curl/7.77.0
#    Accept: */*
#
#    curl: (52) Empty reply from server
#    [1]  + 47611 done       python single_socket.py
```

### A primitive web server

!tldr{
    Using select() to multiplex multiple connections in an infinite loop...
}

Of course accepting one single request and terminating doesn't make for a very useful web server (*not that the following code will be any more useful...*).

We can modify this basic logic to create a server that keeps accepting requests in an infinite loop.

But in order to do that, we need to make some key changes!

- We need to make sure the sockets don't block (see `(2)`)
- We need to multiplex the multiple connections with a selector (see `(3)`, explained in [#selectors]({{< relref "#selectors" >}}))

``` py
# servr.py

import socket
import selectors

# (1) Init socket, allow reuse address (SO_REUSEADDR)
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
s.bind(('', 8082))
s.listen(10)

# (2) Don't block
s.setblocking(False)

# (3) Use a selector
sel = selectors.DefaultSelector()

# Called when server socket has something to accept
def accept(sock):
    conn, _ = sock.accept()
    conn.setblocking(False)
    sel.register(conn, selectors.EVENT_READ, read)

# Called when client socket has data to .recv()
def read(conn):
    data = conn.recv(1024).decode("utf-8")
    if data:
        print(data)
    else:
        sel.unregister(conn)
        conn.close()

# (3a) Register socket and monitor read events
sel.register(s, selectors.EVENT_READ, accept)

try:
    while True:
        events = sel.select()
        for key, mask in events:
            callback = key.data     # (4) Callback
            callback(key.fileobj)
finally:
    sel.close()
```

Now, when we run this with `python servr.py`, we can repeatedly hit the server with `curl localhost:8082/hello/world` and it won't shutdown.

1. We've kept the same socket initialisation code, but moved it out of a `with` context so that we don't close it. Also note `.setsockopt()` to set `SO_REUSEADDR=1`, allowing reuse of bound ports.
2. We configure the socket to be non-blocking
3. Our `sel` Selector will monitor the socket and respond to read events. With the `accept` method registered (see (a)) to the event we can call the callback on read events, which in turn registers the `read` callback for the client socket connections.
4. This is where we respond to the read events and call the callbacks. The `register(_,_,data)` accepts information to pass around with the event, accessible via `key.data`.

### Selectors

The key change here is that we're using Python's I/O multiplexing [`Lib/selectors.py`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/selectors.html)[^py3].  This is the Python API for the [unix system-call `select()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html), in which...

{{< blockquote name="man7.org" link="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html" >}}
select() allows a program to monitor multiple file descriptors,
waiting until one or more of the file descriptors become "ready"
for some class of I/O operation (e.g., input possible).  A file
descriptor is considered ready if it is possible to perform a
corresponding I/O operation (e.g., read(2), or a sufficiently
small write(2)) without blocking.
{{< /blockquote >}}

It's important to remember that **Sockets are File Descriptors**. From the point-of-view of Python, this means that the registered Socket is a buffer-like descriptor, and the selector can monitor `EVENT_READ` and `EVENT_WRITE` events by monitoring the buffers (and not by responding to client request events, or anything network related... i.e. it is purely I/O).

### Parsing the request

We'll quickly wrap up this section by parsing the raw binary request into something useful (pretty self-explanatory, hopefully):

``` py
# servr.py

# ...

def read(conn):
    data = conn.recv(1024)
    if data:
        handle_request(data)
    else:
        sel.unregister(conn)
        conn.close()

def handle_request(raw_request):

    # RFC 2616 Sect. 2.2:
    #   "HTTP/1.1 defines the sequence CR LF as the end-of-line
    #    marker for all protocol elements except the entity-body"
    request_lines = list(map(str.strip, raw_request.decode("utf-8").split('\r\n')))

    # RFC 2616 Sect. 5.1:
    #   "Request-Line   = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF"
    method, path, version = list(map(str.strip, request_lines.pop(0).split()))

    # RFC 2616 Sect. 4.2:
    #   "Each header field consists of a name followed by a
    #   colon (":") and the field value. Field names are case-insensitive.
    headers = {
        x[0].lower(): x[1]
        for x in map(
            lambda x: [x.strip() for x in x.split(":")],
            request_lines[:request_lines.index("")]
        )
    }
    body = request_lines[request_lines.index("")+1].strip()

    print(f"method={method}, path={path}, headers={headers}, body={body}")
```

N.b. see RFC 2616[^rf1] for details on the HTTP message format, in particular [section 4. HTTP Messsage](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-4).

## Adding application logic with WSGI (finally)...

So, we have a web server that can accept requests, but how do we get the server to leverage our Flask app?

Let's dive into the WSGI spec in PEP-3333[^pe1]:

### Application requirements in WSGI

{{< blockquote name="PEP 3333" link="https://peps.python.org/pep-3333/">}}
The WSGI interface has two sides: the ‚Äúserver‚Äù or ‚Äúgateway‚Äù side, and the ‚Äúapplication‚Äù or ‚Äúframework‚Äù side. The server side invokes a callable object that is provided by the application side...

<br>
<br>
...[on the Application/Framework side, t]he application object is simply a callable object that accepts two arguments...
{{< /blockquote >}}

Essentially, an application framework must define a callable object that accepts `environ: dict` and `start_response: Callable`. For example:

``` py
def simple_app(environ, start_response):
    """Simplest possible application object"""
    status = '200 OK'
    response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain')]
    start_response(status, response_headers)
    return [b"Hello world!\n"]
```

Web frameworks like Django and Flask do this for you. For example, you can see this in [Flask `src/flask/app.py` Lines #2081-2086](https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/main/src/flask/app.py#L2081-L2086)[^gi1]:

``` py
# pallets/flask  src/flask/app.py

class Flask(Scaffold):

    # ...

    # L2081-L2086
    def __call__(self, environ: dict, start_response: t.Callable) -> t.Any:
        """The WSGI server calls the Flask application object as the
        WSGI application. This calls :meth:`wsgi_app`, which can be
        wrapped to apply middleware.
        """
        ...
```

### Server requirements in WSGI

{{< blockquote name="PEP 3333" link="https://peps.python.org/pep-3333/">}}
...[on the Server/Gateway side, t]he server or gateway invokes the application callable once for each request it receives from an HTTP client, that is directed at the application.
<br>
<br>

[1]...<br>
... The `environ` dictionary is required to contain [...] CGI environment variables, as defined by the Common Gateway Interface specification...
<br>
<br>

[2]...<br>
...The second parameter passed to the application object is a callable of the form `start_response(status, response_headers, exc_info=None)`... The `start_response` callable is used to begin the HTTP response, and it must return a write(body_data) callable
{{< /blockquote >}}

Put simply, the server/gateway must:

1. populate an `environ: Dict` containing CGI variables that will be used by the application (e.g. `REQUEST_METHOD`),
2. define a `start_response` method which begins the HTTP response
3. Call the application object (e.g. the Flask app) with the above two arguments

Modifying our existing web server from the last section to fit these requirements:

``` py
# servr.py

# ...

application = # Our flask app here

def handle_request(raw_request):
    # ...

    # print(f"method={method}, path={path}, headers={headers}, body={body}

    environ = {
        "wsgi.url_scheme": 'http',
        "REQUEST_METHOD": method,
        "PATH_INFO": path,
    }

    write = lambda data: print(data)
    start_response = lambda status, response_headers, exc_info=None: write

    result = application(environ, start_response)
    try:
        for data in result:
            write(data)
    finally:
        if hasattr(result, 'close'):
            result.close()
```

And when we run our server now, we can see the Flask app correctly routing requests.

The full code is found here [üìë servr.py](/blog/7/servr.py)

``` bash
python servr.py &

curl localhost:8082/hello/world
# b'<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\n<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>\n'

curl localhost:8082/
# b'Hello world\n'
```

Of course, there is **much** more to implement to make this a properly functional server. But hopefully, this shows you the basis of how WSGI works.

## An actual WSGI Server in CPython

Now -- armed with the knowledge of how WSGI servers interact with applications -- let's look at the reference implementation to see a proper WSGI server.

We'll be looking at [python/cpython `Lib/wsgiref/simple_server.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/wsgiref/simple_server.py), [`Lib/http/server.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.2/Lib/http/server.py), and [`Lib/socketserver.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.2/Lib/socketserver.py)[^gi2].

Recall, with the WSGI reference server, we can create a web server like so:

``` py
# Application/Framework
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return "Hello world\n"

# Server/Gateway
if __name__ == '__main__':
    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
    server = make_server('localhost', 4000, app)
    server.handle_request()
```

An overview of what's going on under the hood:

1. In this implementation, the server calls `wsgiref.simple_server.make_server(_,_,app)` passing the WSGI application (e.g. our Flask app) as a positional argument.
2. The reference implementation then instantiates the `wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIServer` class, and binds the application as an attribute.
3. The `wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIServer` will handle the sockets and process the incoming requests
    - It inherits from `http.server.HTTPServer` and `socketserver.TCPServer` which handles the Sockets as we did
    - The base class of these is `socketserver.BaseServer` which defines the methods that are to be called (e.g. `handle_request`)

4. A handler class prototype `WSGIRequestHandler` is bound to the server and for every in-bound request, we will call that class to handle the request.
    - This inherits from `http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler` which parses the HTTP requests from the raw binary (similar, but better, than what we did)
    - This in turn inherits from `socketserver.StreamRequestHandler` which reads the sockets as files
    - <span style='color: #9013fe'>**This is where you will see the WSGI components we discussed (building the `environ` dictionary and passing the `start_response` callable)**</span>.


### Class Hierarchy

For your reference:

```
socketserver.BaseServer
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ socketserver.TCPServer
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ http.server.HTTPServer
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIServer

socketserver.BaseRequestHandler
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ socketserver.StreamRequestHandler
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIRequestHandler
```

### Setting up the sockets & making the server

We start with `BaseServer` ([`Lib/socketserver.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.2/Lib/socketserver.py#L153)[^gi2]). This doesn't do much besides define the key API for the class. [In particular, the `handle_request()` method](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/socketserver.py#L263-L274) we will be using for incoming requests to our server.

``` py
# Lib/socketserver.py L#263

    # The distinction between handling, getting, processing and finishing a
    # request is fairly arbitrary.  Remember:
    #
    # - handle_request() is the top-level call.  It calls selector.select(),
    #   get_request(), verify_request() and process_request()
    # - get_request() is different for stream or datagram sockets
    # - process_request() is the place that may fork a new process or create a
    #   new thread to finish the request
    # - finish_request() instantiates the request handler class; this
    #   constructor will handle the request all by itself

    def handle_request(self):
        ...
```

We then extend `BaseServer` with [`TCPServer`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.2/Lib/socketserver.py#L390)[^gi2] where we can see similar socket setup as we did in our demonstration server in the previous section.

``` py
# Lib/socketserver.py
class TCPServer(BaseServer):
    address_family = socket.AF_INET
    socket_type = socket.SOCK_STREAM

     def __init__(self, ...):
         self.socket = socket.socket(self.address_family,
                                    self.socket_type)

        #...
        if self.allow_reuse_address:
            self.socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

        self.socket.bind(self.server_address)

        #...
        self.socket.listen(self.request_queue_size)

    def get_request(self):
        """Get the request and client address from the socket.
        May be overridden.
        """
        return self.socket.accept()
```

From here, we define our [`WSGIServer`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.2/Lib/wsgiref/simple_server.py#L42)[^gi2] (Omitted `HTTPServer(TCPServer)` because it doesn't do much):

``` py
# Lib/wsgiref/simple_server.py
class WSGIServer(HTTPServer):

    """BaseHTTPServer that implements the Python WSGI protocol"""

    application = None

    def setup_environ(self):
        # Set up base environment
        env = self.base_environ = {}
        env['SERVER_NAME'] = self.server_name
        env['GATEWAY_INTERFACE'] = 'CGI/1.1'
        env['SERVER_PORT'] = str(self.server_port)
        env['REMOTE_HOST']=''
        env['CONTENT_LENGTH']=''
        env['SCRIPT_NAME'] = ''

    def get_app(self):
        return self.application

    def set_app(self,application):
        self.application = application
```

As you can see the `WSGIServer` just initializes the base `environ` dictionary, and exposes a getter & setter for the application.

So when the server calls [`make_server(_,_,app)`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.2/Lib/wsgiref/simple_server.py#L150):

```py
# Lib/wsgiref/simple_server.py
def make_server(
    host, port, app, server_class=WSGIServer, handler_class=WSGIRequestHandler
):
    """Create a new WSGI server listening on `host` and `port` for `app`"""
    server = server_class((host, port), handler_class)
    server.set_app(app)
    return server
```

### Handling the request

When a request comes to the server, we enter through the `handle_request()` method.

In `BaseServer`, [we see the selector pattern as before](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.2/Lib/socketserver.py#L273-L291), after which, it will eventually call the `finish_request` method and load up our request handler class

``` py
# Lib/socketserver.py
class BaseServer:
    def handle_request(self):
        with _ServerSelector() as selector:
            selector.register(self, selectors.EVENT_READ)
            # ...

    def finish_request(self, request, client_address):
        """Finish one request by instantiating RequestHandlerClass."""
        self.RequestHandlerClass(request, client_address, self)
```

The [`BaseRequestHandler`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.2/Lib/socketserver.py#L723-L749)[^gi2] defines a basic API where derived classes override the `setup`, `handle` and `finish` methods:

``` py
# Lib/socketserver.py
class BaseRequestHandler:
    def __init__(self, request, client_address, server):
        self.request = request
        self.client_address = client_address
        self.server = server
        self.setup()
        try:
            self.handle()
        finally:
            self.finish()
```

For TCP sockets we use [`StreamRequestHandler`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.2/Lib/socketserver.py#L769)[^gi2]. This class makes a file from the socket (`.makefile()`) as opposed to directly calling `.recv()` on the connection like we did in our demonstration server. These act as file objects for reading and writing to the socket connection:

``` py
# Lib/socketserver.py
class StreamRequestHandler(BaseRequestHandler):
    def setup(self):
        self.connection = self.request
        # ...
        self.rfile = self.connection.makefile('rb', self.rbufsize)
        # ...
        self.wfile = self.connection.makefile('wb', self.wbufsize)
```

Next in the class hierarchy, the [`BaseHTTPRequestHandler`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.2/Lib/http/server.py#L148)[^gi2] class that the WSGI handler derives from then does the heavy lifting for parsing the request from the binary socket data (much more extensively then we did...):

``` py
# Lib/http/server.py
class BaseHTTPRequestHandler(socketserver.StreamRequestHandler):
    def parse_request(self):
        # ...
        self.command, self.path = command, path
```

This `.parse_request()` method will be called directly by the [`WSGIRequestHandler`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.2/Lib/wsgiref/simple_server.py#L71)[^gi2] which overrides the `.handle()` method called by the server for incoming requests.

``` py
# Lib/wsgiref/simple_server.py
class WSGIRequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):

    def get_environ(self):

        env = self.server.base_environ.copy()
        # ...
        env['REQUEST_METHOD'] = self.command
        # ...
        env['PATH_INFO'] = urllib.parse.unquote(path, 'iso-8859-1')
        # ...
        return env

    def handle(self):
        """Handle a single HTTP request"""

        # ...

        self.parse_request()

        handler = ServerHandler(
            self.rfile, self.wfile, self.get_stderr(), self.get_environ(),
            multithread=False,
        )
        handler.request_handler = self      # backpointer for logging
        handler.run(self.server.get_app())
```

The `ServerHandler` is defined in the same package under [`Lib/wsgiref/handlers`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.2/Lib/wsgiref/handlers.py)[^gi2]

``` py
class BaseHandler:

    def run(self, application):
        # ...
        self.result = application(self.environ, self.start_response)
        try:
            for data in self.result:
                self.write(data)
            self.finish_content()
        except:
            # Call close() on the iterable returned by the WSGI application
            # in case of an exception.
            if hasattr(self.result, 'close'):
                self.result.close()
            raise
        else:
            self.close()

    # ...
    def start_response(self, status, headers,exc_info=None):
        """'start_response()' callable as specified by PEP 3333"""
        ...
```

And there you can see the WSGI required call to `application(environ: Dict, start_response: Callable)`.
